Hallo and welcome to my assignment for practice/work.
Since this App has been made through the Laravel framework some steps need to be prepared befor the app can start.

1.) A PHP server and a Sql server need to be running on the system.
	Here for those who want a quick solutions download and install WAMPSERVER from:
	http://www.wampserver.com/en/#download-wrapper
	Quick and easy no modifications are needed.

2.) Composer needs to be installed on the system for Laravel to function.
	https://getcomposer.org/
	Same as above just download and install.

3.) Node.js is one of the needed requirements to run some commands from the setup of Laravel.
	https://nodejs.org/en/
	Same as above just download and install.

4.) Laravel installation on the system. With the points done above we can install Laravel on our system now.
	To be sure we can check if all need is present on:
	https://laravel.com/docs/5.8 , but the points above should cover it.
	Now run from the console app like CMD on Windows:
	
	composer global require laravel/installer
	
	After this all the necessary files are loaded for creating or working with laravel apps.

5.) Setup of app
	Copy the content from the app to any location you need. People tend to place it directly on the PHP server, 
	but that is not necessary here since we can start it with the composer from anywhere. Still feel free to place it 
	in the PHP servers HTTP folder.
	I have included an SQL backup file with the project to create a Database with the data needed named movie.sql.
	
	Navigate to the main folder of the project and input the following in the console: 
	
	- `composer install`
	- `cp .env.example .env` //main settings file for connection to DB and other servers. Change the part:
	
		DB_CONNECTION=mysql
		DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
		DB_PORT=3306
		DB_DATABASE=movie
		DB_USERNAME=root
		DB_PASSWORD=
	to the data of your local SQL settings.
	
	- `php artisan key:generate`
	
	The next 2 are not needed if you imported the movie.sql file and created a DB with the tables.
	- `php artisan migrate`
	- `php artisan db:seed`
	
	- `npm install`
	- `npm run dev`
	
	- `php artisan serve` // this will run the app through the PHP server and the results can be viewed on:
	<http://127.0.0.1:8000>
	
	You can create new users as you wish. The admin credentials are:
	email:admin@admin.com
	pass:password
